# AI_ML_prediction
AI Machine Learning Portofolio Task: The task was to predict student score based on study hours, then identify the best model between linear regression and decision tree by comparing their R-scores. 

The project involved extensive feature engineering, including checking and dropping duplicates, handling missing values, and addressing outliers. Data Splitting also occured to understanding the importance of splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation. By splitting the data and plotting the results, could get better evaluate and visualize the performance of the linear regression model, ensuring that it not only fits the training data well but also generalizes effectively to new data.
